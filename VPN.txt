tunnel is created with the help of the encapsulation

types of VPN
site -to- site  between two physical office connected over vpn
client/dialup - one mobile user connect to the office network over vpn


based on configuration / implementation
 secure - the vpn we configure are the secured vpn
	 sends encrypted data over the network
	examples
	IPsec
	IPsec whith layer2 tunneling protocol
	ssl or tls with encryption
	point to point tunneling protocol
	microsoft point-to-point encryption
	microsoft secure socket tunneling protocol
	
 trusted - the vpn wich we dont cofigure but we trust them 

	any vpn setup using -
	raw private circuit (teleco)
	private ip network circuit
 
   sub types

 layer 2 VPN		Layer 3 VPN
 ATM circuits		MPLS with BGP
 frame relay

 hybrid - we trust the vpn but use our encryption method over it
